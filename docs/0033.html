		<h3>Conversation</h3>	
        <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            This is the conversation between <span class="bold">a user</span> and <span class="bold">a non-human Artificial Intelligence(AI) assistant</span> on collecting information about 
            <span class="bold" style="text-decoration: underline;">"My Aunt lend me one hundred dollar bill to play with her at casino and I won 6k she gave me two hundred back for winning how much will IRS charge me? I live in Arizona"</span>
            Please read the entire conversation carefully and focus on both the <span class="user-conv">User</span> and <span class="assistant-conv">Assistant</span> turns. 
        </div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>My Aunt lend me one hundred dollar bill to play with her at casino and I won 6k she gave me two hundred back for winning how much will IRS charge me? I live in Arizona</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Sure, I can help you with that. First things first, have you ever reported gambling winnings to the IRS before?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>No, I even don't know what IRS is</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Understood. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is a government agency that collects taxes. When it comes to gambling winnings, they're typically considered taxable income. Do you have any other sources of income that you report for tax purposes?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>umm... maybe part-time job?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I see. Can you tell me roughly how much you earn from your part-time job? This can impact your tax rate.</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>Do you mean monthly or yearly income?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Yearly income would be most helpful for this case. Could you provide that?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I think it's around 5500USD per year</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Thank you for providing that information. Are you aware if your aunt will also be reporting the winnings or any portion of them?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>probably not, I think my aunt will handle that</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Based on the information you've shared, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers all gambling winnings as taxable income. However, the rate at which you'll be taxed can vary. If your only source of income for the year is the $5500 from your part-time job and the $6000 from the gambling winnings, this would put your total income for the year at $11,500. 

As for the year 2021, individuals making less than $12,550 were not required to file a tax return unless they had other specific circumstances. However, the gambling winnings could complicate this as sometimes, a W-2G form is required by casinos for certain gambling winnings, and there are different rules about when you are required to disclose the winnings to the IRS.

To answer your original question, it's hard to say exactly how much you will be charged by the IRS because it depends on a number of factors including your other income, your filing status, and any deductions or credits you may be eligible for. The best course of action would be to consult with a tax professional who can help you understand your obligations and potential deductions or credits in your specific situation. Please note that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific tax laws in your state or city may apply.</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>what if I am international student?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Sure, I'd be happy to help. To start, could you please share where you are originally from and where you're studying?</pre></div>
