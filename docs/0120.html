		<h3>Conversation</h3>

            This is the conversation between <span class="bold">a user</span> and <span class="bold">a non-human Artificial Intelligence(AI) assistant</span> on collecting information about 
            <span class="bold" style="text-decoration: underline;">"I have LG UX 250 sound system but I can't switch to AUX option since I lost original remote. Anymote app doesn't work, so it's there any other solution?"</span>

        </div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I have LG UX 250 sound system but I can't switch to AUX option since I lost original remote. Anymote app doesn't work, so it's there any other solution?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Of course, I'd be happy to assist you with this! To start, does your LG UX 250 sound system have any physical control buttons on it?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>Yea</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>That's great! Can you tell me what options or controls are available on the system's physical buttons?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I dont know their meanings</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I see. Usually, sound systems will have buttons for power, volume, and input or source selection. Do you notice any such buttons or symbols on your device, perhaps a button that has "input" or "source" written on it or a button with an arrow going into a square or circle?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I am not sure, maybe yes. But I am not stay with it</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Understood! It seems you're not currently able to check the system. However, are you aware if your sound system is compatible with universal remotes? Some systems can be controlled with a universal remote if the original one is lost.</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I dont know, it is my first time to use it</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I understand. When you get a chance, it may be worth checking out the manual or the manufacturer's website for your LG UX 250 sound system to see if they mention anything about compatibility with universal remotes. 

But for now, do you know if there's an electronics store nearby where you could possibly find a universal remote or even an original replacement?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>No, I dont have such one</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I see. Considering your situation, have you tried contacting LG's customer service? They might be able to provide you with guidance on how to switch to AUX without the remote or even help replace your lost remote.</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>Yea, but they cant help me</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I'm sorry to hear that LG's customer service wasn't able to assist. Have you considered checking online platforms such as Amazon or eBay for a replacement remote? They often carry replacements for various models.</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>No, I dont want to replacement. I need you to make me know how to use it anyway</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>To answer your original question on how to switch to the AUX option on your LG UX 250 sound system without the original remote, here's a summarization of the possible solutions we've discussed: 

1. Physically on the LG UX 250 unit itself, there might be a button labeled 'source' or 'input' or a button with an arrow going into a square or circle. This button typically allows you to switch between different inputs like AUX, Bluetooth, etc. Since you're not with the sound system at the moment, you may want to check this when you have access to it.

2. As the AnyMote app didn't work for you, consider checking if your sound system is compatible with other universal remote apps. There are several other apps available in the App and Play store like Peel, SURE Universal Remote, and IR Universal Remote. 

3. Lastly, if physical buttons and apps both don't work out, another option could be ordering a replacement remote. You mentioned you're not interested in this, but it's worth keeping in mind if other solutions don't work out.

I hope this provides a conclusive answer to your question and offers a viable solution to your issue. If not, I recommend consulting with a professional technician for further assistance.</pre></div>
