		<h3>Conversation</h3>	
        <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            This is the conversation between <span class="bold">a user</span> and <span class="bold">a non-human Artificial Intelligence(AI) assistant</span> on collecting information about 
            <span class="bold" style="text-decoration: underline;">"What to do when you are feeling lost in life?"</span>
            Please read the entire conversation carefully and focus on both the <span class="user-conv">User</span> and <span class="assistant-conv">Assistant</span> turns. 
        </div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>What to do when you are feeling lost in life?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I'm here to help! Can you tell me more about what is making you feel lost? Are there certain areas in your life where you're feeling particularly unsure or unfulfilled?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I don't know where to pick for leaving. East coast or west coast</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I see. To help you decide, can you tell me what draws you to each coast? What about the East and West coast appeals to you?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>Both the east coast vibe like the NY lifestyle and also west coast like the Washington Oregon lifestyle seem appealing to me</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I see. It seems like you're drawn to different vibes from both coasts. Let's dig a bit deeper. Can you tell me about your work or career? Is it something that can be done from either coast, or are there more opportunities in one area versus the other?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I think it is something that I can do both. The potential job opportunities are exist at the both side</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Understood. Now, let's consider your lifestyle preferences. Are you more of an outdoorsy person who enjoys nature and recreational activities or do you prefer a bustling city with cultural events, dining, and nightlife?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>That's the issue. I like both :slightly_smiling_face:</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I understand, it's hard when you love aspects of both. Let's think about climate then. Do you prefer a range of seasons with a colder winter like you'd find on the East Coast, or a milder, more temperate climate like on the West Coast?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I think I like having different seasons more</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Thanks for sharing that. Having different seasons can indeed be a special experience. Now, let's consider your social connections. Do you currently have family or close friends on either coast and if yes, would being near them influence your decision?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I don't. It is not an impactor factor</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Thank you for that information. Lastly, have you thought about the cost of living? It can vary greatly from the East Coast to the West Coast. Does this factor into your decision-making process at all?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I think these are relatively similar.</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>To answer your original question, "What to do when you're feeling lost in life?", specifically regarding your decision between moving to the East Coast or the West Coast, here's what I can gather from our conversation:

You appreciate both the lively, bustling lifestyle of cities like New York on the East Coast, and the laid-back vibe of places like Washington and Oregon on the West Coast. You enjoy both the cultural offerings of a big city as well as the outdoorsy lifestyle. Your job opportunities are flexible and allow you to choose either coast, and you don't have strong family or friend connections in either place influencing your decision. Lastly, you seem to have a preference for experiencing different seasons, which is more typical of the East Coast climate.

Given these factors, it seems like the East Coast could be a good fit for you. The seasonal changes could provide the variety you like and places like New York offer both the bustling city vibe and access to nature with places like Central Park and nearby hiking trails. Also, the East Coast, particularly New York, boasts a broad range of cultural activities, which seems to align with your interests.

However, this is a significant decision that ultimately you'll have to make based on what feels right for you. Perhaps, if possible, you could consider visiting both coasts for a short period of time to see which lifestyle suits you better before making your final decision. Good luck with your decision-making process!</pre></div>
