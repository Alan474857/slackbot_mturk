		<h3>Conversation</h3>	
        <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            This is the conversation between <span class="bold">a user</span> and <span class="bold">a non-human Artificial Intelligence(AI) assistant</span> on collecting information about 
            <span class="bold" style="text-decoration: underline;">"Why is curry sososo spicy?"</span>
            Please read the entire conversation carefully and focus on both the <span class="user-conv">User</span> and <span class="assistant-conv">Assistant</span> turns. 
        </div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>Why is curry sososo spicy?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Sure, let's dive into why curry might seem exceptionally spicy to you. First off, could you let me know which specific type of curry you find to be spicy? Is it all curries or a certain cuisine's version?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>Indian curry</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Thank you for specifying. Do you typically tolerate other spicy foods well, or do you generally find any spice level to be challenging?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I find any spice level higher than moderate to be challenging</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Understandable. When you eat these spicy Indian curries, do you have them as they are served, or do you add any additional spices or condiments to your dish?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I have them as served</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Alright. On that note, do you know if the Indian curries you're having are typically considered to be some of the spicier dishes in Indian cuisine? Or are they known to be milder?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I think they may be considered spicier</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I see, so the curries you've tasted are on the spicier side. Do you generally enjoy the overall flavors of Indian curries and it's just the heat level that's problematic for you?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>Yes I enjoy the flavors but the heat leve lis problematic</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>I understand. It's important to enjoy the food we eat. Do you usually eat these curries in restaurants, or are they homemade? And if you eat them in restaurants, have you ever tried asking for a milder version?</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>I do eat them in restaurants, I typically do ask for the milder version</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>Understood. Do you typically eat it with rice or bread? Both of these can help to balance out the spiciness of the curry.</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block user"><pre>yeah I eat it with rice</pre></div>
<div class="conversation_block assistant"><pre>To answer your original question, Indian curry can be particularly spicy due to the use of a variety of hot spices and peppers in its preparation. These can include chili powder, cayenne, black pepper, green chilies, and more. 

However, the spiciness of a curry can vary widely depending on the specific recipe and region of India it originates from. Given that you find a higher spice level challenging and you already order the milder version, the curries you've been having may indeed be from regions known for their spicier dishes or the restaurant's interpretation might be on the hotter side.

The good news is that Indian cuisine has a plethora of dishes, many with the rich flavors you enjoy but less heat. There are also ways to mitigate the spiciness. Eating the curry with rice, as you're doing, is a good start. Dairy products, like yogurt or a lassi, which is a traditional Indian yogurt-based drink, can also help counteract the spiciness as they contain casein, a protein that helps to dissolve the capsaicin that gives chili its heat.

So, don't be discouraged. Continue to explore the vast world of Indian cuisine. Maybe try a different restaurant or ask your server for a recommendation for a milder dish. You might just find a new favorite that comes with all the flavor and less of the heat.</pre></div>
